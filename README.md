# Duskdyr's Userscripts Collection
Collection of userscripts I wrote for my needs, mostly focused on improving image quality on social media sites like BlueSky or Twitter.

## HD BlueSky
- While browsing the site, JPEG thumbnails are replaced with full-sized AVIF images.
- When clicking an image, JPEG images are replaced with lossless PNG images.

Full-sized AVIF images are higher quality and of similar size as JEPG thumbnails, so switching to that format while browsing should give you a smooth and higher quality experience without noticeably sacrificing bandwidth. When you click an image, you can get it at its maximum resolution and quality in lossless PNG format, but keep in mind that if a certain image was originally uploaded in JPEG or WebP, then the PNG you get will be as lossy as its origin, but that's still *way* better than the highly compressed JPEG BlueSky serves by default.

## Installation
1. Install one of these userscript managers on your browser. If not sure, choose Violentmonkey, as it's both open source and multiplatform.
- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/)
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
- [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

2. Go to the Greasy Fork page of any of my scripts and install them from there.
